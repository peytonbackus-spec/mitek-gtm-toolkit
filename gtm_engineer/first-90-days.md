# First 90 Days: GTM Engineer

![GTM Engineer](https://img.shields.io/badge/role-GTM%20Engineer-1F6FEB)

Principle: **measure before building.** Every change in days 31–90 has a baseline captured in days 1–30.

## Days 1–30: Audit and baseline

| Week | Focus | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Meet Marketing, SDR leadership, AEs, GTM Systems. Shadow SDR call blocks in Nooks. | Stakeholder map; top 5 pains, in their words |
| 1–2 | Run the [data-quality monitor](../shared_core/data_quality/dq_monitor.py) against live Salesforce (read-only). | Lead and opportunity DQ baseline by rule |
| 2 | Map the current lead lifecycle as it *actually* runs: statuses, routing, Flows, Clay tables, Salesloft enrollment. | As-is diagram plus gaps against the [target spec](lead_lifecycle/lead-lifecycle-spec.md) |
| 3 | Baseline the funnel: conversion by source and segment, speed-to-lead, MQL→SAL SLA. | First version of the [funnel dashboard](funnel_analytics/dashboard-spec.md) |
| 4 | Back-test the current lead score against 12 months of outcomes ([calibration method](lead_scoring/calibrate_scoring.py)). | Is the score monotonic? Which segments are mis-weighted? |

## Days 31–60: Fix the foundation

- Agree the **SQL qualification standard** with Marketing, SDR and AE leads. Ship it as required fields and validation rules.
- Ship **routing v2** (rules R1–R7, with reasons stamped on the record), replay-tested in a sandbox against the last 200 MQLs.
- Re-weight scoring from the back-test. Turn on the two-axis grade (fit × intent).
- Tune the Clay waterfall so Lusha only runs on B+ fit economic-buyer personas. Report credit spend per pipeline $.

## Days 61–90: First AI workflow in production

- **Account research brief** for SDRs: shadow mode for 2 weeks, then assisted. Eval set in CI, with the HITL acceptance rate tracked.
- Baselines already captured: SDR research minutes per account, MQL→SQL conversion, speed-to-lead.
- Day 90 readout: realized gains against those baselines, and the next two workflows prioritized (qualification assist, routing exceptions).

## What I'd ask in week one

1. Where does the lead score live today, and when was it last validated against closed-won?
2. Which routing exceptions do SDR managers fix by hand every week?
3. How are community bank and credit union leads from Fiserv/CSI attributed today?
4. Is there a warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery) with Salesforce synced, or is reporting Salesforce-native only?
5. What is the policy on sending prospect data to AI vendors, and who in security signs off?
6. With Aaron Seyler now running sales, channel, CS and SE under one org, which lead-side changes are already on his list (routing across direct vs channel, SDR structure, tooling)?
